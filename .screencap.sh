# Integrates Mac OS X's screenshot utility with DropBox for easy sharing.

# Starts the interactive screenshot tool, saves it to your public
# Dropbox (if you don't cancel it) where it will be uploaded automatically.
# Copies the public URL to your clipboard and opens your browser to the URL.

## Config

## start interactive screen capture
screencapture -i "$save_to"

## if the screenshot actually saved to a file (user didn't cancel by pressing escape)
if [[ -e "$save_to" ]]; then
    ## echo some output in case you run this in a shell

    ## copy url to the clipboard
    echo "$url" | pbcopy

    ## wait for Dropbox to upload your screenshot, then open in your browser
    sleep $upload_delay_in_second
    ## The `-g` flag means it won't bring your browser to the foreground, which 
    ## feels less like getting interrupted.
